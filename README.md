## Bike Store Sales Analysis Project
The project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of sales data from a bike store using Excel, SQL and Power BI. 

By leveraging SQL queries, various analytical operations were performed to identify trends and understand the Key Performance Indicators (KPI). As the data was distributed across different tables JOINS were used to connect the same. Aggregate functions such as SUM and COUNT were used for efficient analysis and to extract relevant data from the store's database, including sales transactions, customer information, total units sold and revenue generated. 

The extracted data from SQL was then connected with Excel and Power BI for making dashboards.

### For Excel:
The SQL Database was loaded into Excel and SQL query was applied to import only relevant data to Excel sheet. Pivot Tables were created to calculate the Key Performance Indicators (KPI). Pivot Charts were then made based on the pivot tables to visually display the trends and Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

### For Power BI:
The SQL Database was loaded into Power BI. Utilizing Power BI's robust visualization capabilities, insightful reports and dashboards were created to uncover trends, patterns, and key performance indicators (KPIs) in the Bike Store's sales operations. 

This analysis not only provide valuable insights into sales performance but also aid in strategic decision-making, such as optimizing menu offerings, targeting specific customer segments, and enhancing overall business efficiency.
